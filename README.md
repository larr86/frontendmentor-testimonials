## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge 💪🏻

The challenge is to build out this testimonials grid section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size (see design folder for more info about it).
- You will have to calculate margins, padding, font-size, etc.

**This was my final result!** 🤘🏻
